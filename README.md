Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. Selenium provides a replay tool for creating functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language (Selenium IDE). It also provides a domain-specific test language (Selenese) for writing tests in many popular programming languages, including C#, Groovy, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Scala. Tests can be run in most modern web browsers. Selenium runs on Windows, Linux and macOS. It is open source software released under the Apache 2.0 license.
